# React and Gatsby Tech Talk Setup
Follow the steps below to get Gatsby installed on your machine. If you have any questions, bring them on Thursday and we can help you get setup.

### 1. Install NPM

Open up your terminal and check if you have npm:

```
npm -v
```

If you see a version number, then you’re set. If you see “command not found: npm” (or some equivalent), then you can visit https://nodejs.org/en/ and install it (in case you’re wondering why I took you to a node.js site, npm is packaged with node.js).




### 2. Install Git
Check to see if you have git installed already. When you install a Gatsby "starter" site, Gatsby uses Git behind the scenes to download and install the required files for your starter.

```
git --version 
```

If a version shows up, you’re good to go. If not, go to https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git and find the installation instructions for your computer. 


### 3. Install the Gatsby Command Line Interface (CLI)
Run the following command:
```
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

Once that's done processing, check your Gatsby CLI installation by running the following commands:
```
Run gatsby --version.
Run gatsby --help.
```

## And you're all set!
If you get this far, than you’re all ready to go on Thursday. If you run into issues, you can either use the Ionic docs or Google to troubleshoot or shoot me an email at steve.godderidge@gmail.com. 


### BONUS - Check out the Gatsby Starter Page
The Gatsby folks have put in a lot of effort to make their starter page as beginniner-friendly as possible. If you run into any issues, or just want to see how you can start your own project, go to their page:
